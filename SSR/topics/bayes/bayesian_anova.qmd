## Bayesian Hypothesis Testing

* $H_0$, the null hypothesis.  For instance $\theta = .5$ (people cannot taste the difference between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beer).
* $H_A$ is the hypothesis that relaxes the restriction imposed by $H_0$, and instead considers multiple values for $\theta$.

## Prior Belief

$$\large \underbrace{\frac{P(H_A \mid data)}{P(H_0 \mid data)}}_\textrm{Posterior belief} = \underbrace{\frac{P(H_A)}{P(H_0)}}_\textrm{Prior belief} \times \underbrace{\frac{P(data \mid H_A)}{P(data \mid H_0)}}_\textrm{Bayes Factor}$$

## Bayes Factor {.subsection}

$$\underbrace{\frac{P(data \mid H_A)}{P(data \mid H_0)}}_\textrm{Bayes Factor}$$
A ratio of the marginal likelihood of the data under the alternative and the null.

A Bayes factor of ${BF}_{10} = 3$, means that the data are 3 times more likely under the alternative model than under the null model.


## Heuristics for BF {.subsection}

Heuristics for the Interpretation of the Bayes Factor by [Harold Jeffreys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Jeffreys)

BF       | Evidence
---------|----------
 1 – 3   | Anecdotal
 3 – 10  | Moderate
10 – 30  | Strong
30 – 100 | Very strong
>100     | Extreme

## Advantages of the Bayes Factor

* Provides a continuous degree of evidence without requiring an all-or-none decision.
* Allows evidence to be monitored during data collection.
* Differentiates between “the data support H0” (evidence for absence) and “the data are not informative” (absence of evidence).

## Different Models



## Take home message

* Bayesians quantify uncertainty through distributions.
* The more peaked the distribution, the lower the uncertainty.
* Incoming information continually updates our knowledge; today’s posterior is tomorrow’s prior.
