## Factorial repeated measures ANOVA {.section}

The factorial repeated measures ANOVA analyses the variance of the model while reducing the error by the within person variance.

* 1 dependent/outcome variable
* 2 or more independent/predictor variable
    * 2 or more levels
* All with same subjects

## Assumptions

Same as one-way repeated measures ANOVA

## Example {.smaller}

<small>

In this example we will again look at the amount of accidents in a car driving simulator while subjects where given varying doses of speed and alcohol. But this time we lat participants partake in all conditions. Every week subjects returned for a different experimental condition.

* Dependent variable
    * Accidents
* Independent variables
    * Speed
        * None
        * Small
        * Large
    * Alcohol
        * None
        * Small
        * Large
