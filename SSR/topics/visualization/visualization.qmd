## Data visualization

## Why Visualize Data?

- Quick overview of the data
- Spot patterns, outliers, or errors
- Invite the reader

---


## Types of Data and Suitable Graphs

- **Categorical data:** Bar charts, pie charts
- **Continuous data:** Histograms, boxplots, raincloud plots
- **Relationships:** Scatterplots


---

## Distribution plots in JASP

- Used for categorical variables
- Shows frequency or proportion
- Example: Number of students by major

**How to in JASP:**  
1. Go to `Descriptives` > `Descriptive Plots`
2. Select your categorical variable
3. Choose "Bar Plot"

---

## Histograms in JASP

- Used for continuous variables
- Shows distribution shape (normal, skewed, bimodal)
- Example: Distribution of exam scores

**How to in JASP:**  
1. Go to `Descriptives` > `Descriptive Plots`
2. Select your continuous variable
3. Choose "Histogram"

---

## Boxplots: Visualizing Spread and Outliers

- Shows median, quartiles, and outliers
- Useful for comparing groups

**How to in JASP:**  
1. Go to `Descriptives` > `Descriptive Plots`
2. Select variable(s)
3. Choose "Boxplot"

---

## Scatterplots: Relationships Between Variables

- Visualizes association between two continuous variables
- Example: Age vs. cognitive performance

**How to in JASP:**  
1. Go to `Descriptives` > `Descriptive Plots`
2. Select two continuous variables
3. Choose "Scatterplot"

---

## Best Practices in Data Visualization

- Use clear labels and titles
- Avoid unnecessary 3D effects
- Choose appropriate scales
- Check for misleading representations

**Discussion:**  
What makes a graph misleading?

## Critically Assess Graphs

- Are axes labelled (variable, units)?
- Are axes broken/equally spaced?
- Are error bars (e.g., confidence intervals) included where relevant?

## Critically Assess Graphs
```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)

A <- rnorm(10, mean = 5, sd = 3)
B <- rnorm(10, mean = 7, sd = 3)
means <- c(mean(A), mean(B))
ses   <- c(sd(A)/sqrt(length(A)), sd(B)/sqrt(length(B)))
tcrit <- qt(0.975, df = c(length(A)-1, length(B)-1))

# Bad: no axis labels
bp <- barplot(means, names.arg = c("SPSS", "JASP"),
              ylab = "Exam performance",
              col = c("skyblue", "orange"), ylim = c(0, 10), axes = FALSE)
```


## Scale Matters
```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Bad: no axis labels
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
bp <- barplot(means, names.arg = c("SPSS", "JASP"),
              ylab = "Grade (0-10)",
              col = c("skyblue", "orange"), ylim = c(0, 10), axes = FALSE)
axis(2)

bp <- barplot(means, names.arg = c("SPSS", "JASP"),
              ylab = "Grade (0-100)",
              col = c("skyblue", "orange"), ylim = c(0, 10), axes = FALSE)
# Add error bars
# arrows(x0 = bp, y0 = means - ses, x1 = bp, y1 = means + ses,
#        angle = 90, code = 3, length = 0.06, lwd = 1.5)
axis(2, labels = seq(90, 100, 2), at = seq(0, 10, by =2))
```


## Error Bars!
```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Bad: no axis labels
bp <- barplot(means, names.arg = c("SPSS", "JASP"),
              ylab = "Grade (0-10)",
              col = c("skyblue", "orange"), ylim = c(0, 10), axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
arrows(x0 = bp, y0 = means - ses*tcrit, x1 = bp, y1 = means + ses*tcrit,
        angle = 90, code = 3, length = 0.06, lwd = 1.5)

```
