<div class="goals">
In this lecture we aim to:

- Refresh some concepts from previous lectures
- Introduce RM ANOVA
- Introduce Mixed ANOVA
- Show these in JASP
    
<strong>Reading:</strong>
Chapter 14

# What have we learned so far?

- Explaining variance...
- Partitioning explained variance
- For each predictor, what is its model sum of squares?
  - Divide by the error sum of squares of the full model (with all predictors) $\rightarrow$ F-ratio
  
## Having multiple predictors - interaction {.smaller}

- Interaction effects
  - For example [Labocat Leni 13](https://discoverjasp.com/repository/dsj1_leni/leni_13)

### Having multiple predictors - interaction

Assess with:

- Descriptives plots
- Conditional post hoc tests
- Simple main effects

## Having multiple predictors - dependence {.smaller}

- Check independence: dependence = explaining the same variance

- For example [seeing if stress levels differ between two types of therapy](https://johnnydoorn.github.io/teaching-statistics/datasets/2025/dependenceANCOVA.html)

### Having multiple predictors - dependence

Avoid by:

- Experimental manipulation
- Randomization
- Matching

Assess with:

- ANOVA (if categorical + continuous)
- Correlation (if continuous + continuous) $\rightarrow$ block 3
- Chi-squared (if categorical + categorical) $\rightarrow$ block 3


## Contrasts

Contrast 1: compare no alcohol to alcohol

Contrast 2: compare two alcohol conditions

## Assumptions

- Know which ones are relevant
- Know how to assess them
- How to apply corrections in JASP (for unequal variances, sphericity)

# Closing

## Recap

- In a repeated measures design we can account for baseline differences, to reduce the overall model error
- With within-subjects predictors, we need to check:
  - Sphericity (equal variances of difference scores)
- With between-subjects predictors, we need to check:
  - Equal variances of groups
  
## Recommended Exercises

::: {}
- [Exercise 14.4](https://discoverjasp.com/pages/smart_alex#task-14.4),  [Exercise 14.5](https://discoverjasp.com/pages/smart_alex#task-14.5)
- To understand mechanics of RM ANOVA, [Exercise 14.1](https://discoverjasp.com/pages/smart_alex#task-14.1)
- No sums of squares or effect size calculations required for the exam
