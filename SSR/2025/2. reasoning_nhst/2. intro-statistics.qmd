In this lecture we aim to:

* Introduce the S in SSR
* Repeat some stats concepts from RMS
    * "Logic" behind common hypothesis testing
    * Four scenario's in statistical decision making

## About SSR

- Book: Discovering Statistics Using JASP
    - Many pages, but light content
    - Difficulty indications in each section (A/B/C/D)
    - Theory in first half, application in JASP in second half
- [Companion website of book](https://discoverjasp.com) 
        - Data sets

### About SSR
- Lectures:
  - Slightly erratic
  - Starts with conceptual understanding
  - Ends with JASP demonstration
  - Confused? 
      - Read the chapter first
      - Rewatch lecture
      - Ask questions (during lecture, on discussion board)
---

### About SSR
- Practice: 
    - Tutorials, WA in Ans
    - Smart Alex tasks
    - Labcoat Leni examples
    - Self-tests 


## Software
- JASP: main tool for analyses, data management
    - Freely available at [www.jasp-stats.org](www.jasp-stats.org)
    - Also available at libraries, [apps.uva.nl](apps.uva.nl)
- R: very flexible, 100% optional
    - Freely available at [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - Want a nicer environment for coding? Try [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
    - Will be available during exam, but not required to use (can also use Ans calculator)
    - [Free intro course](https://intro2r.com/)
