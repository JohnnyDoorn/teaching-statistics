Four variables were measured: <code>exam</code> (first-year JASP exam scores as a percentage), <code>computer</code> (measure of computer literacy as a percentage), <code>lecture</code> (percentage of JASP lectures attended) and <code>numeracy</code> (a measure of numerical ability out of 15). There is a variable called <code>uni</code> indicating whether the student attended Sussex University (where I work) or Duncetown University.

<p>Transform the <code>numeracy</code> scores (which are positively skewed) using one of the transformations described in this chapter. Do the data become normal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For each Q-Q plot we want to compare the distance of the points to the diagonal line to the same distances for the raw scores. For the raw scores, the observed values deviate from normal (the diagonal) at the extremes, but mainly for large observed values (because the distributioon is positively skewed).</p>
<ul>
<li>The log transformation improves the distribution a bit The positive skew is mitigated by the log transformation (large scores are made less extreme) resulting in dots on the Q-Q plot that are much closer to the line for large observed values.</li>
<li>Similarly, the square root transformation mitigates the positive skew too by having a greater effect on large scores. The result is again a Q-Q plot with dots that are much closer to the line for large observed values that for the raw data.</li>
<li>Conversely, the reciprocal transformation makes things worse! The result is a Q-Q plot with dots that are much further from the line than for the raw data.</li>

<p>A student was interested in whether there was a positive relationship between the time spent doing an essay and the mark received. He got 45 of his friends and timed how long they spent writing an essay (hours) and the percentage they got in the essay (<code>essay</code>). He also translated these grades into their degree classifications (<code>grade</code>): in the UK, a student can get a first-class mark (the best), an upper-second-class mark, a lower second, a third, a pass or a fail (the worst). Using the data in the file <code>essay_marks.jasp</code> find out what the relationship was between the time spent doing an essay and the eventual mark in terms of percentage and degree class (draw a scatterplot too).</p>

<p>A study was carried out to explore the relationship between aggression and several potential predicting factors in 666 children who had an older sibling. Variables measured were <code>parenting_style</code> (high score = bad parenting practices), <code>computer_games</code> (high score = more time spent playing computer games), <code>television</code> (high score = more time spent watching television), <code>diet</code> (high score = the child has a good diet low in harmful additives), and <code>sibling_aggression</code> (high score = more aggression seen in their older sibling). Past research indicated that parenting style and sibling aggression were good predictors of the level of aggression in the younger child. All other variables were treated in an exploratory fashion. Analyse them with a linear model (<code>child_aggression.jasp</code>).</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="coldwell2006">Coldwell et al. (<a href="#ref-coldwell2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> investigated whether household chaos predicted children’s problem behaviour over and above parenting. From 118 families they recorded the age and gender of the youngest child (<code>child_age</code> and <code>child_gender</code>). They measured dimensions of the child’s perceived relationship with their mum: (1) warmth/enjoyment (<code>child_warmth</code>), and (2) anger/hostility (<code>child_anger</code>). Higher scores indicate more warmth/enjoyment and anger/hostility respectively. They measured the mum’s perceived relationship with her child, resulting in dimensions of positivity (<code>mum_pos</code>) and negativity (<code>mum_neg</code>). Household chaos (<code>chaos</code>) was assessed. The outcome variable was the child’s adjustment (<code>sdq</code>): the higher the score, the more problem behaviour the child was reported to be displaying. Conduct a hierarchical linear model in three steps: (1) enter child age and gender; (2) add the variables measuring parent–child positivity, parent–child negativity, parent–child warmth, parent–child anger; (3) add chaos. Is household chaos predictive of children’s problem behaviour over and above parenting? (<code>coldwell_2006.jasp</code>).</p>

<p>Both Ozzy Osbourne and Judas Priest have been accused of putting backward masked messages on their albums that subliminally influence poor unsuspecting teenagers into doing Very Bad things. A psychologist was interested in whether backward masked messages could have an effect. He created a version of Taylor Swift’s ‘Shake it Off’ that contained the masked message ‘deliver your soul to the dark lord’ repeated in the chorus. He took this version, and the original, and played one version (randomly) to a group of 32 veterinary students. Six months later he played them whatever version they hadn’t heard the time before. So each student heard both the original and the version with the masked message, but at different points in time. The psychologist measured the number of goats that the students sacrificed in the week after listening to each version. Analyse the data (whether the type of music you hear influences goat sacrificing) in <code>dark_lord.jasp</code>, using a paired-samples <em>t</em>-test.</p>

<p>To test how different teaching methods affected students’ knowledge I took three statistics modules (<code>group</code>) where I taught the same material. For one module I wandered around with a large cane and beat anyone who asked daft questions or got questions wrong (punish). In the second I encouraged students to discuss things that they found difficult and gave anyone working hard a nice sweet (reward). In the final course I neither punished nor rewarded students’ efforts (indifferent). I measured the students’ exam marks (<code>exam</code>). The data are in the file <code>teaching.jasp</code>. Fit a model with planned contrasts to test the hypotheses that: (1) reward results in better exam results than either punishment or indifference; and (2) indifference will lead to significantly better exam results than punishment.</p>

A researcher hypothesized that a stretching warm-up before playing would help lower injuries, and that athletes would be less susceptible to injuries because their regular activity makes them more flexible. She took 60 athletes and 60 non-athletes (<code>athlete</code>); half of them played on a Nintendo Switch and half watched others playing as a control (<code>switch</code>), and within these groups half did a 5-minute stretch routine before playing/watching whereas the other half did not (<code>stretch</code>).

<p>Research suggests that people who can switch off from work (<code>detachment</code>) during off-hours are more satisfied with life and have fewer symptoms of psychological strain <span class="citation" data-cites="sonnentag_psychological_2012">(<a href="#ref-sonnentag_psychological_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Sonnentag, 2012</a>)</span>. Factors at work, such as time pressure, affect your ability to detach when away from work. A study of 1709 employees measured their time pressure (<code>time_pressure</code>) at work (no time pressure, low, medium, high and very high time pressure). Data generated to approximate Figure 1 in <span class="citation" data-cites="sonnentag_psychological_2012">Sonnentag (<a href="#ref-sonnentag_psychological_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> are in the file <code>sonnentag_2012.jasp</code>. Carry out a chi-square test to see if time pressure is associated with the ability to detach from work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, put the variable <code>time_pressure</code> into the box called <em>Rows</em>, <code>detachment</code> into the box called <em>Columns</em>, and <code>frequency</code> into the box called <em>Counts.</em></p>
<p>The results/settings can be found in the file <a href="/repository/dsj1_alex/alex_16_01.jasp">alex_16_01.jasp</a>. The results can be viewed in your browser <a href="/repository/dsj1_alex/alex_16_01.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The chi-square test is highly significant, <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>(4) = 15.55, <em>p</em> = .004, indicating that the profile of low-detachment and very low-detachment responses differed significantly across different time pressures.</p>
<p>Looking at the standardized residuals, the only time pressure for which these are significant is very high time pressure, which showed the greatest split of whether the employees experienced low detachment (36%) or very low detachment (64%). Within the other time pressure groups all of the standardized residuals are lower than 1.96. It’s interesting to look at the direction of the residuals (i.e., whether they are positive or negative). For all time pressure groups except very high time pressure, the residual for ‘low detachment’ was positive but for ‘very low detachment’ was negative; these are, therefore, people who responded more than we would expect that they experienced low detachment from work and less than expected that they experienced very low detachment from work. It was only under very high time pressure that the opposite pattern occurred: the residual for ‘low detachment’ was negative but for ‘very low detachment’ was positive; these are, therefore, people who responded less than we would expect that they experienced low detachment from work and more than expected that they experienced very low detachment from work.</p>
<p>In short, there are similar numbers of people who experience low detachment and very low detachment from work when there is no time pressure, low time pressure, medium time pressure and high time pressure. However, when time pressure was very high, significantly more people experienced very low detachment than low detachment.</p>

<p>I wrote much of the third edition of this book in the Netherlands (I have a soft spot for it). The Dutch travel by bike much more than the English. I noticed that many more Dutch people cycle while steering with only one hand. I pointed this out to one of my friends, Birgit Mayer, and she said that I was a crazy English fool and that Dutch people did not cycle one-handed. Several weeks of me pointing at one-handed cyclists and her pointing at two-handed cyclists ensued. To put it to the test I counted the number of Dutch and English cyclists who ride with one or two hands on the handlebars (<code>handlebars.jasp</code>). Can you work out which one of us is correct?</p>

<p>The results/settings can be found in the file <a href="/repository/dsj1_alex/alex_16_06-07.jasp">alex_16_06-07.jasp</a>. The results can be viewed in your browser <a href="/repository/dsj1_alex/alex_16_06-07.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The value of the chi-square statistic is 5.44. This value has a two-tailed significance of .020, which is smaller than .05 (hence significant), which suggests that the pattern of bike riding (i.e., relative numbers of one- and two-handed riders) significantly differs in English and Dutch people. The significant result indicates that there is an association between whether someone is Dutch or English and whether they ride their bike one- or two-handed.</p>
<p>Looking at the frequencies, this significant finding seems to show that the ratio of one- to two-handed riders differs in Dutch and English people. In Dutch people 17.2% ride their bike one-handed compared to 82.8% who ride two-handed. In England, though, only 9.9% ride their bike one-handed (almost half as many as in Holland), and 90.1% ride two-handed. If we look at the standardized residuals (in the contingency table) we can see that the only cell with a residual approaching significance (a value that lies outside of ±1.96) is the cell for English people riding one-handed (<em>z</em> = -1.9). The fact that this value is negative tells us that fewer people than expected fell into this cell.</p>

<p>The odds of someone riding one-handed if they are Dutch are:</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{odds}_\text{one-handed, English} = \frac{17}{154} = 0.11

<p>Therefore, the odds ratio is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{odds ratio} = \frac{\text{odds}_\text{one-handed, Dutch}}{\text{odds}_\text{one-handed, English}} = \frac{0.21}{0.11} = 1.90

<p>In other words, the odds of riding one-handed if you are Dutch are 1.9 times higher than if you are English (or, conversely, the odds of riding one-handed if you are English are about half that of a Dutch person).</p>
